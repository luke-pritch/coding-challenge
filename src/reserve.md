# May I interest you in Reserve?

## What is [Reserve](https://reserve.org)?

- Two coins and a smart contract protocol creating a decentralized form of a central bank.

- First coin RSV a stable coin pegged to USD in the short to medium term, long term independant of USD with RSV as its own form of value

- Second coin RSR (you buy this) the protocol token that will get arbitraged and burned as the protocol mints RSV to those that wish to use it

## Where does it stand today?

- Reserve team has been targetting Latin American countries with volatile currencies starting with Venezuela in 2019 and adding Argentina and Columbia in 2020.

- 2021 plans for more users in Latin America and possibly expanding to the Middle East.

## Is it too late to buy?

No, at the time of writing RSR is 0.04, it may go up it may go down. But I'm hoping for it to be anywhere between .25 to 1.00 in a year or two. Possibly several dollars years from now IF the team delivers. Under .05 is a good buy if you plan to hold for 12-24 months.

Possible pumps this year:

- Mainnet (the protocol goes live) no definitive date other than sometime 2021.
- Coinbase listing, [on the short list of coins being considered](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-custody-explores-support-for-new-digital-assets-d3b521bc6816)

## Where do I buy?

- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), best way would probably be buy BTC/ETH on Coinbase and send it to Binance to exchange

## How do I store it?

- RSR is an ERC-20 placeholder token at the moment. Send it to any wallet that accepts Ethereum and ERC tokens. [MyEtherWallet (MEW)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) can be found in the app store to store it on your phone.

## [Investors](https://reserve.org/investors)

- Peter Thiel (cofounded Paypal, Palantir, paid Vitalik to drop out and found Ethereum)
- Sam Altman (former YCombinator president, invested in Airbnb, Stripe Reddit)

- Coinbase Ventures (Coinbase was inucbated at YCombinator)

- Both Thiel and Altman have attended Bilderberg meetings.
